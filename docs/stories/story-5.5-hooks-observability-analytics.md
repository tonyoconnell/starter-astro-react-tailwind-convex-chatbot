## Dev Notes

### Comprehensive Logging System

The logging system will capture detailed information about every Claude Code operation:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-09T10:30:45.123Z",
  "eventType": "PostToolUse",
  "tool": "Edit",
  "duration": 1234,
  "metadata": {
    "file": "/path/to/file.ts",
    "linesChanged": 42,
    "pattern": "**/*.ts"
  },
  "hooks": [
    {
      "name": "format-typescript",
      "duration": 523,
      "status": "success",
      "output": "Formatted 1 file"
    }
  ],
  "sessionId": "uuid-v4",
  "agentId": "main",
  "contextSize": 12500
}
```

### Voice Notification Integration

Natural language notifications will provide friendly updates:

```javascript
// Technical event
{
  "eventType": "PostToolUse",
  "tool": "MultiEdit",
  "files": ["auth.ts", "user.ts", "session.ts"],
  "status": "success"
}

// Natural language notification
"Successfully updated 3 authentication files. All tests are passing."
```

### Sub-agent Monitoring

Track parallel execution of sub-agents:

```json
{
  "eventType": "SubagentStop",
  "parentAgent": "main",
  "subAgents": [
    {
      "id": "test-runner",
      "task": "Run unit tests",
      "duration": 5234,
      "status": "completed",
      "resourceUsage": {
        "cpu": "45%",
        "memory": "256MB"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "linter",
      "task": "Check code quality",
      "duration": 2156,
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ],
  "totalDuration": 5234,
  "parallelEfficiency": "87%"
}
```

### Performance Analytics

The analytics engine will provide insights such as:
- Average hook execution time by type
- Most frequently used tools
- Error patterns and failure analysis
- Development velocity metrics
- Code quality trends over time
- Sub-agent utilization patterns

### Chat Transcript Capture

Stop hooks will capture full conversations:

```json
{
  "eventType": "Stop",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-09T11:45:00.000Z",
  "conversation": {
    "id": "conv-uuid",
    "duration": 1800000,
    "messages": [...],
    "toolsUsed": ["Edit", "Read", "Bash"],
    "filesModified": 12,
    "testsRun": 45,
    "outcome": "completed"
  }
}
```

### Implementation Architecture

1. **Logging Infrastructure**
   - Use Bun's file system APIs for high-performance log writing
   - Implement async log queue to prevent blocking
   - Create log rotation based on size and time

2. **Voice Notification Service**
   - Primary: macOS `say` command for local TTS
   - Fallback: Web Speech API or cloud TTS service
   - Queue system for non-blocking notifications

3. **Analytics Processing**
   - Background worker for log analysis
   - SQLite database for metrics storage
   - Real-time dashboard using Server-Sent Events

4. **Privacy and Security**
   - AES-256 encryption for sensitive logs
   - Configurable PII patterns (emails, API keys, etc.)
   - Automatic log expiration based on retention policy

### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "observability": {
    "logging": {
      "enabled": true,
      "level": "detailed",
      "rotation": {
        "maxSize": "100MB",
        "maxAge": "7d",
        "compress": true
      },
      "privacy": {
        "redactPII": true,
        "encryption": "aes-256-gcm"
      }
    },
    "notifications": {
      "voice": {
        "enabled": true,
        "engine": "system",
        "voice": "Samantha",
        "rate": 1.2
      },
      "events": [
        "stop",
        "error",
        "milestone"
      ]
    },
    "analytics": {
      "enabled": true,
      "realtime": true,
      "retention": "30d"
    }
  }
}
```
