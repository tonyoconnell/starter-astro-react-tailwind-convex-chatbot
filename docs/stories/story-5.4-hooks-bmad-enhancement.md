## Dev Notes

### BMAD Method Overview
The BMAD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) is a framework for AI-accelerated development with specialized agents:
- **Planning Agents**: `/pm`, `/architect`, `/analyst`
- **Development Agents**: `/dev`, `/qa`, `/ux-expert`
- **Management Agents**: `/po`, `/sm`, `/bmad-master`

### Hook Integration Opportunities

#### 1. Development Phase Enhancement
```json
{
  "PostToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit",
      "pattern": "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "name": "bmad-quality-gate",
          "command": "/path/to/bmad-quality-hook.sh {file}",
          "timeout": 15000
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Story Validation Hooks
- Validate story acceptance criteria before implementation
- Ensure proper BMAD documentation format
- Check for required story elements (user story format, tasks, dev notes)

#### 3. Agent Workflow Hooks
- Automatically log agent transitions and context switches
- Validate agent-specific file patterns and conventions
- Ensure proper handoff documentation between agents

### Strategic Benefits for BMAD

#### Quality Assurance
- **Automated Testing**: Hooks ensure tests run after every code change
- **Code Standards**: Consistent formatting and linting across all BMAD stories
- **Documentation**: Automatic validation of story format and completeness

#### Security & Compliance
- **Credential Protection**: Prevent accidental secret commits during development
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all development activities
- **Compliance**: Ensure regulatory requirements are met automatically

#### Developer Experience
- **Reduced Context Switching**: Automatic quality checks reduce manual verification
- **Fast Feedback**: Immediate notification of issues during development
- **Consistency**: Standardized workflows across all BMAD agents

### ROI Calculation Framework
1. **Time Savings**: Reduced debugging and rework time
2. **Quality Improvements**: Fewer production issues and security vulnerabilities
3. **Compliance**: Automated audit trail and regulatory compliance
4. **Developer Satisfaction**: Reduced manual tasks and faster feedback

### Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Core development hooks (testing, linting, formatting)
- **Phase 2**: Security and compliance hooks
- **Phase 3**: Advanced BMAD workflow automation
- **Phase 4**: AI-powered code analysis and suggestion hooks

## Dependencies
- Requires Epic 5 Stories 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 to be completed
- Access to BMAD method documentation and workflows
- Understanding of current BMAD pain points and bottlenecks

## Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
