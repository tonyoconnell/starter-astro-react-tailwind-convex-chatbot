# Story 5.3: Security and Notification Hooks

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** security hooks and custom notifications,
**so that** sensitive files are protected and I receive relevant development feedback

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PreToolUse hooks block modifications to sensitive files
2. Security patterns prevent accidental credential commits
3. Custom notification hooks provide development feedback
4. Stop/SubagentStop hooks perform cleanup tasks
5. Hook bypass mechanism exists for emergency situations
6. Audit trail tracks all hook interventions

  - [x] Create sensitive file protection list
  - [x] Add credential scanning hooks
  - [x] Configure environment file protection
- [x] Build notification system (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create notification command infrastructure
  - [x] Add success/failure notifications for builds
  - [x] Implement custom notification templates

  - [x] Add SubagentStop hooks for task completion
  - [x] Implement temporary file cleanup
- [x] Create bypass mechanism (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add `--no-hooks` flag support
  - [x] Implement per-hook bypass options
  - [x] Create emergency override configuration
- [x] Set up audit system (AC: 6)
  - [x] Log all hook interventions
  - [x] Track bypass usage

## Dev Notes

### Hook Configuration Example
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "pattern": "**/.env*|**/secrets/**|**/*key*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo 'BLOCKED: Attempting to modify sensitive file'",
            "blockExecution": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "rm -rf .tmp .claude-cache"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Notification": [
      {
        "event": "build-complete",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo '✅ Build completed successfully'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Security Considerations
- Sensitive files: `.env*`, `**/secrets/`, `**/*key*`, `**/*token*`, `**/*password*`
- Credential patterns: API keys, tokens, passwords
- Use existing .gitignore patterns as baseline
- Integration with existing auth system (BetterAuth)
- Convex environment variables protection

### Notification Options
- Console output for CLI environments
- System notifications where available
- Log file entries for all events
- Integration with development workflow

### Dependencies
- Requires Story 5.1 to be completed (configuration infrastructure)

## QA Results

**QA Status: ✅ APPROVED**  
**Reviewed By:** Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)  
**Review Date:** 2025-07-08  

### Architecture Quality: EXCELLENT
- **Hook Configuration**: Robust JSON schema with comprehensive security patterns and notification events
- **Security Model**: Multi-layered protection with file pattern matching, credential scanning, and audit trails
- **Bypass System**: Well-designed emergency override with proper access control and audit logging
- **Notification Architecture**: Multi-channel support (console, system, file, webhook) with template system

### Implementation Quality: VERY GOOD
- **Security Hook** (`security-hook.sh`): Comprehensive credential detection patterns, proper file classification
- **Notification Hook** (`notification-hook.sh`): Cross-platform system notifications with fallback mechanisms  
- **Bypass Utility** (`hook-bypass.sh`): Granular control with JSON configuration and history tracking
- **Test Coverage**: Extensive integration tests covering all major functionality paths (226 lines)

### Key Strengths
1. **Security Patterns**: Covers 12 sensitive file patterns and 10 credential detection patterns
2. **Cross-Platform**: macOS/Linux compatibility with appropriate fallbacks
3. **Performance**: Efficient pattern matching with timeout controls (5s for credential scans)
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging and history for security compliance

### Security Assessment: ✅ APPROVED
All security hooks follow defensive security best practices and implement proper protection mechanisms. No malicious patterns detected.

### Minor Improvements Identified
- Error handling could be enhanced in webhook notifications (non-blocking issue)
- jq dependency should have more graceful degradation (fallback exists)
- Some test cases could benefit from stronger assertions (coverage adequate)

### Test Results Summary
- **Total Tests**: 14 test suites covering security, notifications, cleanup, and bypass systems
- **Coverage**: All major functionality paths tested with integration scenarios
- **Performance**: Debouncer and caching mechanisms validated
- **Cross-Platform**: macOS compatibility verified for all components

### Production Readiness: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
This implementation meets all acceptance criteria and follows enterprise security standards.
