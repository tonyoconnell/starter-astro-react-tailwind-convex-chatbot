## Detailed Demo Script

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
```
"What if your AI coding assistant could not only write code, but also ensure it's perfect, 
secure, and production-ready - automatically? Today, I'll show you how Claude Code Hooks 
transforms AI pair programming into a complete engineering platform."
```

### Demo 1: The Basics - Format, Test, Protect (3 minutes)

**Setup:** Show a typical coding session without hooks
- Developer makes changes
- Forgets to format
- Misses a failing test
- Accidentally commits a secret

**Transformation:** Enable basic hooks
```bash
# Show the hooks configuration
cat .claude/claude-code-hooks.json

# Make an edit that triggers formatting
claude "Add a new authentication endpoint"
# â†’ Show automatic formatting happening

# Try to edit a file with failing tests
claude "Update the user model"
# â†’ Show hook blocking the edit with test failures

# Attempt to add an API key
claude "Add my OpenAI key to the config"
# â†’ Show security hook preventing the commit
```

**Key Talking Points:**
- "Zero-config quality assurance"
- "Catches issues before they become problems"
- "Works with your existing tools (Turborepo, Prettier, ESLint)"

### Demo 2: Development Workflow Enhancement (3 minutes)

**Scenario:** Complex refactoring task
```bash
# Show intelligent test execution
claude "Refactor the authentication module to use JWT"
# â†’ Hook runs only affected tests, shows caching

# Demonstrate parallel linting
# â†’ Multiple files checked simultaneously

# Show build verification
# â†’ Incremental builds for speed
```

**Visual Elements:**
- Split screen showing:
  - Claude Code making changes
  - Terminal showing hook execution
  - Performance metrics overlay

**Key Talking Points:**
- "Intelligent test execution - only runs what's needed"
- "Performance optimized with caching and parallelization"
- "Respects monorepo boundaries"

### Demo 3: Security & Notifications (2 minutes)

**Scenario:** Team collaboration
```bash
# Show notification on successful deploy
claude "Deploy to staging"
# â†’ Desktop notification appears

# Demonstrate audit trail
cat .claude/security-audit.log
# â†’ Show comprehensive activity logging

# Show bypass mechanism for emergencies
claude --no-hooks "Emergency fix for production"
```

**Key Talking Points:**
- "Complete audit trail for compliance"
- "Flexible notification system"
- "Emergency bypass with full tracking"

### Demo 4: Advanced Observability (4 minutes) ðŸŒŸ NEW

**The "Wow" Moment:** Voice notifications and real-time analytics

```bash
# Enable voice notifications
claude "Implement the new payment processing feature"

# As Claude works, you hear:
ðŸ”Š "Starting implementation of payment processing feature"
ðŸ”Š "Successfully created 3 test files. All tests passing."
ðŸ”Š "Security scan complete. No vulnerabilities detected."
ðŸ”Š "Feature implementation complete. 15 files modified, 100% test coverage."
```

**Show the Analytics Dashboard:**
```bash
# Open real-time dashboard
open http://localhost:3000/claude-analytics

# Display shows:
- Session timeline with all operations
- Performance metrics per operation
- Sub-agent execution graph
- Error rate trends
- Code quality scores over time
```

**Demonstrate Sub-agent Monitoring:**
```bash
# Complex task that spawns sub-agents
claude "Implement full CRUD API with tests and documentation"

# Dashboard shows parallel execution:
- Main agent: Orchestrating
  â”œâ”€â”€ test-writer: Creating test suite (45% CPU)
  â”œâ”€â”€ api-builder: Implementing endpoints (38% CPU)
  â””â”€â”€ doc-generator: Writing OpenAPI spec (17% CPU)
```

**Key Talking Points:**
- "Natural language updates keep you informed without interrupting flow"
- "Deep insights into AI agent performance and resource usage"
- "Identify bottlenecks and optimize your AI workflows"

### Demo 5: Programmable Hooks API (5 minutes) ðŸŒŸ NEW

**The "Platform" Moment:** Claude Code as an engineering primitive

**Single-file Hook Creation:**
```python
# Create a custom hook in 30 seconds
cat > my-pr-validator.py << 'EOF'
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = ["httpx", "pydantic"]
# ///

import httpx
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HookEvent(BaseModel):
    tool: str
    file: str

async def handle_hook(event: HookEvent):
    if "test" not in event.file:
        return {"warn": "No test file found for implementation"}
    return {"allow": True}
EOF

# Register it dynamically
claude-hooks register ./my-pr-validator.py
```

**Show Composition Patterns:**
```typescript
// Build complex workflows by composing simple hooks
const prReviewPipeline = createPipeline([
  securityScanHook,
  testCoverageHook,
  performanceCheckHook,
  documentationHook
]);

// Use Claude Code in your CI/CD
await claudeCode.review(pullRequest);
```

**Demonstrate External Integration:**
```bash
# Configure webhook for GitHub Actions
claude-hooks webhook add github \
  --url "https://api.github.com/repos/myrepo/dispatches" \
  --events "Stop,Error"

# Now every Claude Code session triggers your CI/CD
```

**Show `claude -p` Power User Mode:**
```bash
# Use Claude Code as a Unix pipe
git diff | claude -p ./explain-changes.js | slack-cli post

# Chain multiple Claude instances
find . -name "*.test.ts" | \
  claude -p ./test-analyzer.py | \
  claude -p ./test-improver.ts
```

**Key Talking Points:**
- "Build custom hooks in minutes, not hours"
- "Compose Claude Code into your existing workflows"
- "Turn AI assistance into programmable infrastructure"
- "Share hooks with your team via the marketplace"

### Demo 6: The BMAD Integration Story (2 minutes)

**Show BMAD Enhancement:**
